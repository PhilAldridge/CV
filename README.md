#### Academy Graduate Software Engineer at BJSS Ltd.

I am a software engineer at BJSS Ltd., after going through their Academy program, which started in September 2023. [BJSS](https://www.bjss.com/) is a leading technology and engineering consultancy for business, collaborating with some of the worldâ€™s leading organisations to deliver complex, innovative technology, engineering, and industry solutions. During the seven week academy, I learned several different languages and frameworks as well as abstract techniques such as: Agile methodology, clean code, design patterns and SOLID fundamentals, continuous integration/deployment, concurrency, and versioning. Before this, I was a teacher of Mathematics and Computer Science at GCSE and A-level with a special responsibility for delivering stretch and challenge for more able students. I have always been a hobbyist coder and had made several personal projects in various languages before finally deciding to make my interest a career when I joined BJSS.

## Skills

#### Creativity and problem solving
I am a naturally creative person. Whether I am teaching, drawing, writing, making music, cooking or coding, I enjoy approaching things from different angles and testing out different ideas. This allows me to see solutions to problems that others may not think of. When facing a new challenge, I am confident that eventually, through trying new things and learning around the subject, I will be able to find an effective solution (and that I will enjoy the struggle of finding it).

#### Pace of learning
I love to learn new things and I have become adept at picking up new things and applying them quickly. For my first Android App, Cable Chaos, I had no experience with Unity or C#, but through online resources I was able to create something unique and engaging within a few weeks. In order to make my first database driven website, Decypher, I read a book on SQL and PHP and was able to achieve my vision. I am comfortable in situations where I don't know everything and I am not afraid of asking questions in order to further my understanding.

#### Teamwork and communication
Teaching requires excellent communication and I have become very effective at both explaining topics to others and understanding the perspective of others. As well as teaching students, I have led training sessions for the teachers of mathematics in department meetings and INSET days. I have created exemplary teaching resources that are now used as the standard across a five school trust. I also led a collaboration of mathematics and science departments where together we decided how best to teach and structure topics which are common to both subjects. I have recently been part of a project exploring how teachers can most effectively deploy and communicate with teaching assistants.

#### Mathematical knowledge
As a mathematics graduate at the University of Birmingham, my mathematical knowledge is very strong. I have found applying this knowledge when coding to be very useful, particularly when creating efficient and robust algorithms to solve complex problems and when trying to understand existing algorithms, like the fast fourier trasnform and its many applications.

## Personal projects
As well as working on confidential projects with BJSS, I have created several personal projects that are visible on my Github profile. Some of these are listed below.

## Interests
- Music - I have a grade 5 in piano. I also enjoy playing the guitar and enjoy making a noise out of any instrument I can get my hands on.
- Art - My daughter has become interested in drawing and I have loved drawing along side her and trying to remember things I have learned in GCSE art all those years ago.
- Travelling - I have travelled extensively around Europe and South America (mostly before I had children). I love the adventure and the chance to experience different ways of life and I look forward to doing more of this as the children get older.
- I also enjoy cycling, cooking, literature and socialising over a good board game.
